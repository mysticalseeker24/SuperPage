## 🔧 **Feature Engineering Details**

### **ProjectID**
- **Implementation**: UUID-based 8-character identifiers
- **Example**: `66fb4655`, `0bf673d3`, `01bce836`
- **Uniqueness**: Guaranteed unique across all datasets

### **TeamExperience** 
- **Dummy**: Gamma distribution (2-8 years typical)
- **Startup**: Mapped from investment stage (Seed=2.5, Series A=5.5, etc.)
- **VC**: Calculated from company age / 3 with variation
- **Range**: 0.5 to 15.0 years

### **PitchQuality**
- **Dummy**: Beta distribution (most pitches mediocre)
- **Real Data**: Derived from funding success + random component
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (NLP-style scores)

### **TokenomicsScore**
- **Dummy**: Balanced beta distribution
- **Real Data**: Higher for tech companies and operating status
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (fairness metric)

### **Traction**
- **Dummy**: Log-normal distribution for realistic user counts
- **Real Data**: Scaled from funding amounts as proxy
- **Type**: Integer (normalized user/star counts)

### **CommunityEngagement**
- **Dummy**: Weighted combination of simulated social metrics
- **Real Data**: Based on industry type and funding success
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (normalized social metrics)

### **PreviousFunding**
- **Dummy**: Log-normal distribution for realistic funding amounts
- **Real Data**: Direct mapping from cleaned funding data
- **Type**: Float (USD amounts)

### **RaiseSuccessProb**
- **Implementation**: Weighted combination of all features
- **Weights**: [0.15, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.15, 0.10]
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (continuous probability)

### **SuccessLabel**
- **Dummy**: Binary based on RaiseSuccessProb > 0.6 (100% funding goal)
- **Real Data**: Based on actual funding success and operational status
- **Type**: Integer {0, 1}
