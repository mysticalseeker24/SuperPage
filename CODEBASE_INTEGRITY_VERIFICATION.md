- `backend/prediction_service/Dockerfile` - ✅ INTACT
- `backend/preprocessing_service/Dockerfile` - ✅ INTACT  
- `backend/blockchain_service/Dockerfile` - ✅ INTACT
- `backend/ingestion_service/Dockerfile` - ✅ INTACT

**Original Requirements**: All original requirements files remain **completely untouched**
- `backend/prediction_service/requirements.txt` - ✅ INTACT
- `backend/prediction_service/requirements-prod.txt` - ✅ INTACT
- `backend/preprocessing_service/requirements.txt` - ✅ INTACT
- `backend/preprocessing_service/requirements-prod.txt` - ✅ INTACT
- All other requirements files - ✅ INTACT

**Application Code**: All Python application code remains **completely untouched**
- `main.py` files - ✅ INTACT
- `model_loader.py` - ✅ INTACT
- All business logic - ✅ INTACT
- All API endpoints - ✅ INTACT
- All ML functionality - ✅ INTACT

### 2. Frontend Components - FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVED ✅

**What Was Changed**: Only ESLint compliance fixes
- Removed unused imports (no functional impact)
- Fixed unescaped apostrophes (`'` → `&apos;`)
- Removed unused variables (no functional impact)

**What Was Preserved**: All core functionality
- ✅ All React components work exactly the same
- ✅ All form validation logic intact
- ✅ All API calls and data flow intact
- ✅ All user interactions preserved
- ✅ All styling and animations preserved
- ✅ All wallet integration preserved
- ✅ All routing and navigation preserved

### 3. Smart Contracts - COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED ✅

- ✅ All Solidity contracts intact
- ✅ All HardHat configuration intact
- ✅ All deployment scripts intact
- ✅ All contract addresses preserved

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline - MINIMALLY MODIFIED ✅

**Only Change**: Removed problematic Docker cache settings
- ✅ All test workflows preserved
- ✅ All build steps preserved
- ✅ All deployment logic preserved
- ✅ Only cache configuration modified (non-functional)

## 🆕 What Was Added (Additive Only)

### Railway-Specific Files (New Additions)
1. `backend/prediction_service/Dockerfile.railway` - **NEW FILE**
2. `backend/prediction_service/requirements-railway.txt` - **NEW FILE**
3. `backend/preprocessing_service/Dockerfile.railway` - **NEW FILE**
4. `backend/preprocessing_service/requirements-railway.txt` - **NEW FILE**
5. `backend/blockchain_service/Dockerfile.railway` - **NEW FILE**

### Documentation Files (New Additions)
1. `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - **NEW FILE**
2. `CODEBASE_INTEGRITY_VERIFICATION.md` - **NEW FILE**
