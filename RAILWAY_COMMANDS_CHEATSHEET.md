# 4. Or get URL and run schema manually
# Copy DATABASE_URL from railway variables output
# psql [DATABASE_URL] -f scripts/setup-postgres-schema.sql
```

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Check all services status
railway status

# Test health endpoints
curl https://superpage-ingestion.up.railway.app/health
curl https://superpage-preprocessing.up.railway.app/health
curl https://superpage-prediction.up.railway.app/health

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **‚ùå Incorrect Commands:**
```bash
# DON'T USE THESE:
railway service create [name]           # Old syntax
railway variables get [key]             # Doesn't exist
railway variables set KEY=value         # Wrong format
railway up --service [name]             # Service flag not needed
```

### **‚úÖ Correct Commands:**
```bash
# USE THESE INSTEAD:
railway add --service [name]            # Create service
railway variables                       # View all variables
railway variables --set "KEY=value"     # Set variable
railway up                              # Deploy (after linking)
```

## üìû Help Commands

```bash
# Get help for any command
railway --help
railway add --help
railway variables --help

# Check Railway CLI version
railway --version

# View current user
railway whoami
```

---

**üéØ Key Points:**
- Always link to service before deploying: `railway service [name]`
- Use `railway variables` (no get/set subcommands) to view variables
- Use `railway variables --set "KEY=value"` to set variables
- Deploy from the correct service directory with `railway up`
